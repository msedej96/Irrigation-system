# Irrigation-system
Embedded irrigation system to provide a more optimal amount of water to the plants.

The device is capable to control of 8 electromagnetic valves (with the extension even more). It also has a sensor for measuring temperature and humidity in the air, as well as moisture in the soil.
The valves can be controlled according to a time schedule or according to the level of moisture in the soil. Manual control is also possible.
Everything can be managed via the web interface. The local web server runs on the microcontroller itself.

The heart of the embedded system is an 32-bit ESP8266 MCU with a Wifi connection.
